Dear, Principal

If u change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raised their grade but if they cant what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding. If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities.
